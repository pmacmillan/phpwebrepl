Just a stupid experiment

0) install dependencies

	npm install

1) start the app

	node app

2) navigate to: http://localhost:9001

There is a bare minimal UI right now. Enter any PHP and press ENTER. It will go to the repl and will be executed.

(Some browsers might insist on CTRL+Enter, but you are just submitting the form).
